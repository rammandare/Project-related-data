Setup:
ansible+git+EC2+Maven


Install "publish Over SSH" plugin and restart jenkisn if required: (Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins > Available > Publish over SSH)

Enable connection between Ansible and Jenkins:

for best practice:
create a generic user on both the ansible instance and tomcat instance:

useradd -m -d /home/ansibleuser ansibleuser

set password for that user:
passwd ansibleuser


Manage Jenkins > Configure System > Publish Over SSH > SSH Servers
SSH Servers:
Hostname:<ServerIP>
username: XXXXXXX
password: *******

Test the connection "Test Connection"

login to ansible VM:
create a folder in /opt/playbooks once logged in via "ansibleuser"

create a yml file which will copy the stuffs to several tomcat instances:

---
 - hosts: tomcat
   become: true
   tasks:
           - name: copy war file onto tomcat instance
             copy:
                     src: /opt/playbooks/target/webapp.war
                     dest: /opt/apache-tomcat-8.5.40/webapps

PS: add the internal IP's of the tomat instances inside /etc/ansible/hosts adn make sure that few adhoc comamnds get executed:
ansible -m ping all


Jenkins Job create:
we can craete new job adn use settings to copy from the latter job:


goto : post steps:
send files or publish over ssh (this will come if plugin was installed)

transfer:
source file: webapp/target/*.war
remote dir : //opt//playbooks

add 1 more publish over ssh:

exec command we need to add and leave other as blank:
ansible-playbook /opt/playbook/copy.yml



Add post build steps:


Execute job and you  should be able to seen build has been deployed on Tomcat server.
try accesing the page via :
publicIPof tomcatinstance:8090/webapp
